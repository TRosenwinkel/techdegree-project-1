        <h2>Academic and Professional Background</h2>
        <p>I graduated from high school in 2010 and went to Corning Community College where I earned an associates degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences. I then went on to Mansfield University where I earned a bachelor's degree in History. </p>
        <p>After graduating from college I quickly learned of the shortage in opportunity in the history field, especially in a small town like Corning, New York. I found a job at a local credit union as a teller and quickly moved to IT as a Client Support Specialist. After some time in that position I then was promoted to Systems Administrator.</p>

        <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
        <p>There has always been something about coding that peeked my interests. I've always had the pre-concieved notion that writing code was for math geniuses and never really pursued it. After some time in the IT field, I have found that my understanding of what it takes to be a web developer has changed  and I would really like to pursue a career in the field.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the part that interests me the most is the creative side of developing websites. Not only the visual creativity in terms of designing images and layouts, but finding different ways to create a user friendly website that is pleasing to use with elegant code.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Aside from learning web development, I love the outdoors. Upstate New York is close to so many natural attractions like Watkins Glenn State Park and the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon, it's easy to find outdoor activities to enjoy.</p>

        <p>Music is another area of interests. There is nothing like going to see your favorite artists live in concert. Two of my favorite shows that I've ever been to were Bon Iver and Ben Howard.</p>
